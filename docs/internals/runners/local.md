# Local backend

## Configuration

The logic for setting up the local-backend configuration of a given `WorkflowTask` is implemented in the
[get_local_config](../../reference/fractal_server/app/runner/executors/local/get_local_config.md)
submodule.

This configuration includes a single (optional) parameter, namely the integer variable `parallel_tasks_per_job`. This parameter is related to tasks that needs to be run in parallel over several inputs: When `parallel_tasks_per_job` is set, it will represent the maximum number of tasks that the backend will run at the same time.

The typical intended use case is that setting `parallel_tasks_per_job` to a small number (e.g. `1`) will limit parallelism when executing tasks requiring a large amount of resources (e.g. memory).


The different sources for `parallel_tasks_per_job` are:

1. If the `WorkflowTask.meta` field has a `parallel_tasks_per_job` key, the corresponding value takes highest priority;
2. Next priority goes to a `parallel_tasks_per_job` entry in `WorkflowTask.task.meta`;
3. Next priority goes to the configuration in `FRACTAL_LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE`, a JSON file that may contain a definition of a
   `LocalBackendConfig` object like
```JSON
{
  "parallel_tasks_per_job": 1
}
```
4. Lowest-priority (that is, the default) is to set `parallel_tasks_per_job=None`, which corresponds to _not_ limiting parallelism at all.
