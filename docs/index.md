# Fractal Analytics Framework

Fractal is a framework developed at the [BioVisionCenter](https://www.biovisioncenter.uzh.ch/en.html) to process bioimaging data at scale in the OME-Zarr format and prepare the images for interactive visualization.

This is the server component of the fractal analytics platform (find more
information about Fractal in general and the other repositories at the [Fractal
home page](https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io)). The source code is
available on the [fractal-server GitHub
repository](https://github.com/fractal-analytics-platform/fractal-server).
