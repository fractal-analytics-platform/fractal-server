Fractal is a framework developed at the [BioVisionCenter](https://www.biovisioncenter.uzh.ch/en.html) to process bioimaging data at scale in the OME-Zarr format and prepare the images for interactive visualization.

This is the server component of the fractal analytics platform (find more information about Fractal in general and the other repositories at the [Fractal home page](https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io)). The source code is available on the [fractal-server GitHub repository](https://github.com/fractal-analytics-platform/fractal-server).
