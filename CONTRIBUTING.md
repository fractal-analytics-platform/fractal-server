## Git / Branches

The default branch for this repository is `main`.
Releases are made by pushing a tag (with some specific label, e.g. `1.2.3`) from a branch (typically from `main`). This then triggers the creation of a PyPI release.
The `main` branch is not meant to be stable over time: breaking changes for an u meant to always be ready for a release, but it is not meant to be stable over time
