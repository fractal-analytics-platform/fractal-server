This backend runs Fractal workflows using `FractalThreadPoolExecutor` (a custom
version of Python
[ThreadPoolExecutor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor))
to run tasks in several threads.
Incidentally, it also represents the reference implementation for a backend.

    Run a workflow

    This function is responsible for running a workflow on some input data,
    saving the output and taking care of any exception raised during the run.

    NOTE: This is the `local` backend's public interface, which also works as
    a reference implementation for other backends.

    Args:
        workflow:
            The workflow to be run
        input_paths:
            The paths to the input files to pass to the first task of the
            workflow
        output_path:
            The destination path for the last task of the workflow
        input_metadata:
            Initial metadata, passed to the first task
        logger_name:
            Name of the logger to log information on the run to
        workflow_dir:
            Working directory for this run.
        workflow_dir_user:
            Working directory for this run, on the user side. This argument is
            present for compatibility with the standard backend interface, but
            for the `local` backend it cannot be different from `workflow_dir`.
        slurm_user:
            Username to impersonate to run the workflow. This argument is
            present for compatibility with the standard backend interface, but
            is ignored in the `local` backend.
        user_cache_dir:
            Cache directory of the user who will run the workflow. This
            argument is present for compatibility with the standard backend
            interface, but is ignored in the `local` backend.
        worker_init:
            Any additional, usually backend specific, information to be passed
            to the backend executor. This argument is present for compatibility
            with the standard backend interface, but is ignored in the `local`
            backend.

    Raises:
        TaskExecutionError: wrapper for errors raised during tasks' execution
                            (positive exit codes).
        JobExecutionError: wrapper for errors raised by the tasks' executors
                           (negative exit codes).

    Returns:
        output_dataset_metadata:
            The updated metadata for the dataset, as returned by the last task
            of the workflow
