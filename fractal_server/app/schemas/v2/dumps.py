"""

Dump models differ from their Read counterpart in that:
* They are directly JSON-able, without any additional encoder.
* They may only include a subset of the Read attributes.

These models are used in at least two situations:
1. In the "*_dump" attributes of Job models;
2. In the `_DatasetHistoryItem.workflowtask` model, to trim its size.
